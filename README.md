# Libft

Libft is a foundational **42 École** project focused on building a personal C library by reimplementing standard **libc** functions.

The main objective of this project is to strengthen core C programming skills and gain a deep understanding of low-level concepts such as memory management, pointers, and data manipulation.

This library is designed to be reused in future 42 projects, providing a reliable set of commonly used utility functions.

## Objectives
- Understand how standard C library functions work internally
- Improve memory management and pointer handling skills
- Write clean, reusable, and norm-compliant C code

## Features
- Reimplementation of standard libc functions
- Additional helper and utility functions
- Custom linked list implementation
- Written in pure C following 42 coding norms

## Usage
Compile the library using:
```sh
make

#include "libft.h"
